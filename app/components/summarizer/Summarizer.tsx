// The summarizer should call an API to get all the count data
// currently available for the corpus.
// The summarizer should be able to display word counts, collocations and three- and four-word lexical bundles information
// calculated from the corpus.
// The summarizer should also be able to display the data for each subcorpus.
// The summarizer should also be able to display the data for the whole corpus.

// There are THREE possible scenarios here:
// 1. The user has already performed the necessary operations in which case we should get and show the data.
// 2. The user has not performed the necessary operations in which case we should show a message to the user.
// 3. The user has performed the necessary operations but has also updated the corpus and altered the data, in which case
// we should show a message to the user and ask them to perform the operations again.

// Each individual component should be responsible for calling the data from the API and displaying it.
